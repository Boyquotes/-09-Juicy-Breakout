# -09-Juicy-Breakout
This is a fun assignment in which I attempt to make Brick Breaker a fun game in Godot!
I tried to implement a second level, however I got stuck looking up how to create a global variable (which is apparently pretty hard in Godot and a disadvantage to using this program) so I just left the scene how it was just to show that I can change levels and for future reference. I tried making scenes and copying scenes to reduce the amount of retyping of code I would have to do with the second scene. This might have also complicated the process of making a second level as I was trying to use scenes from my Game root scene. I think I learned my lesson with that. Otherwise, I learned how to take a gif, turn it into a series of pictures and animate the pictures again in Gogot which was pretty fun. (Make sure you check out the Game Over screen) Furthermore, I edited the colllision box for the paddle to be a 6 sided polygon which have a flat part and two slight angles on the top surface of the paddle to control the direction of the ball more. I added music and a theme to the background and blocks to make a 8bit I Kissed a Girl brick breaker level. I feel that after this project I could make a title screen, a level,a win screen, and a gameover screen. I feel a bit more confused about making multiple levels after this experience though. Hope youm like the gifs and 8bit music... oof
